					5. The Red Network is designed in such a way that the issue of its deployment in the event of an Emergency Force majeure, ban, removal
					etc., was as simple as possible. Such a network does not require high computing power and large storage capacity.
					Any specialist of not the highest level can deploy an archive copy on a new server.
					The exchange of information within the network is mainly textual information. The ability to upload photos, videos, audio to the network
					materials are limited in order to be independent of server resources and to reduce hosting as much as possible,
					which, if necessary, could be mastered by everyone.

					looking for the best ways to achieve a person as a goal. In achieving a society where a person
					will no longer be a means. But we understand the need for intermediate actions, the need to fight
					and realize the evolution of consciousness, which is necessary and which cannot occur right now.
					</p>

					</p>
					<p>
					8.Our attitude towards J.V. Stalin and L.D. Trotsky. We consider them to be the best practices, even though they made mistakes. We are alien
					dogmas and disputes over the actions of these two historical figures. We believe that the issue of assimilation of experience
					it is necessary to approach soberly and comprehensively.
